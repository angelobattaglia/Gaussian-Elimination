# Gaussian-Elimination-Cpp
Gaussian Elimination algorithm on a random Hilbert Matrix. Pivoting is included into the algorithm. At first it says: "Inserisci la dimensione della matrice di Hilbert" that means
"Insert the dimension of the Hilbert matrix". You insert one integer, then the computation starts, and the results are displayed.
